# Settings

[mod-setting-name]
bzgas-recipe-bypass=Bypass recipes
bzgas-list=Make a list of modified recipes
bzgas-more-intermediates=Enable more intermediates
bzgas-handcraft=Add hand-craft circuit recipe
bzgas-boiler=Enable ElAdamo's fluid boiler
bzgas-force-spawn=Force starting spawn
bzgas-finite=Finite natural gas

[mod-setting-description]
bzgas-recipe-bypass=Skip modifying these recipes (comma-separated list).
bzgas-list=If enabled, the text command [color=orange]BZList[/color] will dump a file to the script-output directory with a full list of recipes modified.\nRecommended to turn this off after you are done configuring your other settings.
bzgas-boiler=Natural gas mod currnelty can incorporate ElAdamo's public domain fluid boiler. If that mod is updated to 1.1, this may be removed.
bzgas-handcraft=This enables an alternative wood-based handcrafting-only recipe for electronic circuits. Defaults to off, as bakelite only takes a few steps to make, but provided to enable varying playstyles.
bzgas-force-spawn=Force a spawn of natural gas in the starting area, if the game does not spawn one.
bzgas-finite=Makes natural gas finite with a constant production rate.

[string-mod-setting]
